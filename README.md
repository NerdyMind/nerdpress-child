NerdPress Child
===============

This is a starter child theme designed for use with [NerdPress](https://github.com/NerdyMind/nerdpress) as a way of easily modifying the behavior of the theme without modifying the core theme files themselves. To modify a theme component, simply copy the file you wish to change into this child theme and the original will be overridden.

CSS/LESS changes can be made in ```assets/less/child.less```. This file will be added to the NerdPress compiler whenever changes to the file are detected.
